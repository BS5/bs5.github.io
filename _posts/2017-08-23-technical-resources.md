A friend recently asked me a question that I found really helpful to answer for 
myself. He asked what I use to stay up to date on my programming. This should 
be an easy question for most but as I started replying with all of the great 
resources that I know about, I really evaluated which I actually use. There are
plenty of other resources like podcasts, youtube channels, learning sites and 
others. Those are still great for learning something new or refreshing a topic 
when I have time but that's not what I use everyday. Here is the answer that I 
gave him.

To stay up to date on various languages, I generally am reading the language 
documentation itself.

For most immediate issues that I need answers for I use Google/Stack overflow.

I am mostly writing Java for Android but am also touching or have touched 
recently Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Shell scripting, iOS/Swift, JavaScript, Ember, 
Angular. To stay up to date on all of these I usually try to go straight to 
the sources that are creating these languages.

Android  
https://developer.android.com/  
https://developers.google.com/  

Ruby  
http://ruby-doc.org/  

Ruby on Rails  
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/  
http://api.rubyonrails.org/  

Shell scripting  
https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html  
(This one more of a Googler)  

iOS/Swift  
https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html  

JavaScript  
https://www.javascript.com/  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript  

Ember  
https://www.emberjs.com/api/ember/2.14/namespaces/Ember  

Angular  
https://angular.io/docs  

For more HTML/CSS/JS resources, I have used these in the past. Some I have outgrown and some I still use.
